        </h5>
        <p>Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train is one of the best anime films of all-time period. This movie absolutely deserves the praise its getting. I have a lot of list to explain why this is one of the best films of all-time. Spoilers for those who haven't watched it yet.

          The Story: the story stays perfectly faithful to the manga version. While in the manga, Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke went to the train to find Rengoku to ask about Tanjiro's ability, the movie version changes as a mission for the four to aid him in hunting down the demon attacking the train. However, most of the moments in this movie are incredibly faithful to the manga, showing how well the writers were perfectly staying faithful to the manga.
          
          The Visuals: As expected from many studios, the animation gives us stunning visuals, with the train's design, the battles, and even the design of (SPOILER) Enmu's train fusing body. the animation must have taken days, so the designers hard works pays off as we blessed with beautiful animation. The battles in particular, are praise-worthy, as we see the characters' fighting styles once more, and the animation we are gifted to see. 
          
          The Characters and voice acting: Like last time, Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke becomes more likeable than ever from their funny moments to their epic battles, it's really nice to see them again. both the Japanese and English voice actors still do a splendid job with their roles. the villains, Enmu and (SPOILER) Akaza, are also incredible great villains as they give our heroes a major struggle. Their Japanese and English voice acting are also done well. However, beside Tanjiro, we have to give the critical acclaim praise towards one of the greatest supporting characters, Kyojuro Rengoku, the Flame Hashira. In the tv series, we see Rengoku and what type of a man he is. The movie even gives us a much more clearer type of person Rengoku truly is. He's incredibly kind, heroic, noble, and honorable as he fights to protect mankind and always smiles. His voice actors, both the Japanese and English done a perfect job of Rengoku.
          
          The Music Score: The music is just... wow. Incredibly beautiful. The action-music, the heart-warming/tearjerker-music, just any type of music this movie throw at you will give you such emotions. Homura by LISA is an Oscar-worthy song to listen to. But if you do listen, and somewhat understand what she's singing about, prepare for tears.
          
          And now... the BIG ONE. BIG SPOILER ALERT! Read at your own risk.
          
          Tanjiro and Rengoku: These two are the biggest main characters of this movie in my opinion. And for good reasons. We see that Tanjiro wishes to learn about his ability, Hinokami Kagura Dance and Rengoku, who sees great interest in him, offers to become his mentor. Tanjiro and Rengoku are almost similar in a way, as they both have siblings who they deeply love and are both honorable and heroic warriors, who wish to end Muzan and bring peace to mankind. And just as we thought, that after Tanjiro and Inosuke finally defeat and killed Enmu, the heroes earn their victory, the Upper Moon 3, Akaza arrives and tries to recruit Rengoku while Akaza tries to kill Tanjiro and the 200 passengers, including Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke. And after a fierce fight, Rengoku ultimately loses his life, but not before encouraging Tanjiro to lift his heart ablaze and giving out one last smile on his face. This greatly affects Tanjiro, as he's deeply sadden by his death. It show how much influence Rengoku had on Tanjiro.
          
          Overall, this is one of the greatest films ever to be seen and I hope you all enjoy it! LIFT YOUR HEART ABLAZE! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</p>

        </h5>
        <p>This film is very good and artistic in my opinion. It was a super genius idea for Ruben Fleischer to direct a spin-off based off of the most famous villain from Spider-Man. Not only did they bring him back as a villain like in Spider-Man 3 but turning him into a superhero.
           Marvel must have been obsessed with the whole anti-hero movie-type spiel kinda like how DC was when they just recently made Birds of Prey when they bring back Harley Quinn not in her super-villain routine but instead bringing her back into a superhero.
            But anyways, let's get back to talking about Venom! It begins with a journalist named Eddie Brock who gets superpowers by being infected by an extraterrestrial symbiote which species plans to invade earth and nothing else you could expect besides Venom just going around killing around people more like in his super-villain routines.
             One last thing, I love the mid-credits which kinda makes sense to me which means the film is gonna spawn a sequel. But at least I will get high hopes for the other Marvel movies such as The New Mutants, Black Widow, and Morbius. Gonna give this 5 stars.</p>

        </h5>
        <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it
          could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it
          had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original
          better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly
          meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>
